# Ants_Simulation
There are several NetLogo simulation for calculating self-organization level.
- c: centralized system -- ants do not leave chemicals behind, they just walk randomly unless they encounter the preset chemicals (that does not evaporate)   in the environment.
- s: self-organized system -- chemicals are only left by ants that brings food back to the colony, the chemicals will evaporate over time
- h: hybrid system -- we place preset chemical in the system, but only some ants can detect them and follow.  All ants can leave regular chemicals for others and the chemicals will evaporate over time
